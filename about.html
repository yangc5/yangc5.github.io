        <h2>About Chen Yang</h2>
        <p>A little about my background: I am a software product development manager who is super passionate about technology. I started my current role about two years ago fresh out of grad school, and during this job I have had the opportunity to learn about many aspects of software development process. What I enjoy the most about being a product manager is I get to be the bridge between our development team and business team, and in the center of how the whole product come together.

On weekends when Iâ€™m not learning coding, I enjoy cycling, kayaking, cooking, and great movies. I currently live in Austin, TX.</p>
